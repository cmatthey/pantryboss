Final project report
Recipe matcher and pantry management app
Description
Pantry Boss is a recipe matcher and pantry management app. It helps users find recipes by ingredient/s. It matches ingredients from a recipe and inventory from a user and only shows recipes available to the users based on the ingredients the user has in his/her pantry. It also tracks pantry inventory. Once a user selects and confirms a recipe, the pantry inventory will be automatically adjusted to reflect ingredient usage. A user can edit the pantry inventory after the pantry has been restocked with new ingredients.  This is a multi-user application. A user registers to create an account, then logs in to use the application.
